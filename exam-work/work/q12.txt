(a)

there is an edge from T2 -> T1 (T2 R(Y) -> T1 W(Y)) and there is an edge from T1->T2 (T1 W(X) -> T2 W(X))
Schedule is not conflict serializable because its conflict graph is cyclic.

(b)
in the concurrent schedule
X: T3 writes final
Y: T2 reads init, T1 writes final

T1:                 W(Y) W(X)

T2:  R(Y) W(X)

T3:                                 W(X)

is the view equivalent
