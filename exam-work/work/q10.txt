# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q10

(a)
Flights ... fid -> from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price
Aircraft ... aid -> aname, range
Certified ... -> no non-trivial fd
Employees ... eid -> ename, salary

(b)
A table is in BCNF if and only if for every non-trivial FD, the LHS is a superkey.
the Flights ... fid -> from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price violates BCNF
as the relation is not a BCNF, the schema is not BCNF

in practical, there is no way to know whick aircraft or pilot will be flying for a practical Flights
wherefore, it can be improved by adding aid into the Flights relation

Flights(fid, aid, from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price)
Aircraft(aid, aname, range)
Certified(employee, aircraft)
Employees(eid, ename, salary)

where aid is a foreign key of Aircraft(aid)
