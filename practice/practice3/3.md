1. no worker can have more than 100% of their time allocated
2. a manager must spend all of their time in just one department

```sql
create domain DepartmentsID as char(3) check (VALUE in ('001','002','003'));
create domain DepartmentsList as text check (VALUE in ('Administration', 'Research', 'Sales'));
create domain MissionsList as varchar(20) check (VALUE in ('innovation', 'reliability', 'profit', 'technology','customer-focus', 'growth'));

create table Employees (
	tfn         char(11) check (tfn ~ '^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}$') primary key,
	givenName   varchar(30) not null,
	familyName  varchar(30),
	hoursPweek  float check (hoursPweek >= 0 and hoursPweek <= 168)
);

create table Departments (
	id          DepartmentsID primary key,
	name        DepartmentsList unique,
	manager     char(11) references Employees(tfn)
);

create table DeptMissions (
	department  char(3) references Departments(id),
	keyword     MissionsList,
	primary key (department, keyword)
);

create table WorksFor (
	employee    char(11) references Employees(tfn),
	department  char(3) references Departments(id), 
	percentage  float check (percentage >=0 and percentage <=100)
);
```

notes:
```
PostgreSQL has a method for specifying that constraint checking should be delayed to the end of a transaction which is described in the section on deferrable constraints in the documentation on the create table statement, and with additional explanation in the set constraints documentation. You'll also need to read the doumentation on begin and commit to work out how to implement it. (You can also find an explanation of this in the last couple of questions in Exercises 03).
