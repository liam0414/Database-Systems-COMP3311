# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q9

(a)
When the last member of a group leaves (i.e. all members are noted as departed)

the group should be recorded as disbanded
use the value of member's departure data as the date of disbanding
joined (date the performer joined the group), departed (date the performer left the group).

CREATE FUNCTION function_name () RETURNS trigger
AS
$$
    DECLARE
        declarations;
    BEGIN
        statements;
    END; 

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;



CREATE TRIGGER che
    BEFORE operatio 
    ON group
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE function_name()
    ;

(b)

a new Groups entry should be made, using the value of current_date as the formation date

you can assume that there is some method available to generate new group id's

(write an assumption to this effect; any reasonable assumption is acceptable)

all musicians who were members of the old group should be entered as members of the new group

all musicians where were members of the old group should be marked as having left the old group


-- update the status of old group and insert new group
CREATE FUNCTION update_group() RETURNS trigger
AS
$$
DECLARE
    _id        integer;
    _name      text;
    _formed     date;
    _disbanded  date;
BEGIN
    old.disbanded = now();
    select id,name,formed,disbanded into _id, _name, _formed, _disbanded
	from Groups where id=new.id;
    new.name = _name
    return new;
END; 

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_group BEFORE update on Groups
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_group();
